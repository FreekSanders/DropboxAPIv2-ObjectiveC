# DropboxAPIv2-ObjectiveC
Swift wrapper class for using Dropbox API v2 within an Objective C project

It's all about the "DropboxService.swift" file.
This file allows projects working with the SwiftyDropbox CocoaPod to be written in Objective-C.

The default CocoaPod uses Swift constructs that are incompatible with Objective-C.
This project tries to eleviate part of that problem.

Note: this is only a partial implementation of all SwiftyDropbox functions.
